# walint

The Web Annotation Linter, `walint`, is a tool for validating a web service's compliance with the [W3C Web Annotation Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/). The service's validation will be graded among how it implements “must” and “should” requirements of the specification.

This project is under active development. A gist of all rules can be retrieved [here](rules.md).
